Small function to save, load, overwrite and delete vim sessions.
:mkview and related commands are not difficult to manage but where to save the sessions and  with what name is sometimes tricky.

This plugin use a dedicate folder ($VIM/vimfiles/session/) to save all sessions, using as name the full path-name to the associated file. This way you don't have to worry about where have you saved your sesion; just you only have to remember what file is associated to the session, open it and press <Shift-F3>
The functions can be accessed both in the "plugin -> Sessions" tab or with the keyboard.

Usage
---------
Manage it from the menu in plugins or with the keyboard:
<F3> to save a session
<Shift-F3> to load a session
<Crtl-Shift-F3> to overwrite an existing session
d<F3> to delete an existing session
